# TicTacToeWithDatabase
TicTacToe game implemented by java. I decided to add database connectivity(JDBC) to store results of games, show player statistics and created account registration and logining.

# How to play
1. Register or sign in account. If you sign in account you will get your game stats.

2. Start to play: just write the coordinates of the cell. (for example: 1 1, this means that you have chosen the first cell)
